The project sumbission contains the following:

(1) the tidy data file that was requested by the assignment (tidy_data.txt); you can read into R using read.table()
(2) the code book (CodeBook.md) with a description of the data and data processing steps
(3) the R script (run_analysis.R) - to run, type source("run_analysis.R"); you will find the full data set in the "data" data frame, the subset of data containing the mean and standard deviation columns in the "sub_data" data frame and the 'tidy' data in the "tidy_data" data frame
(4) Two more points:
    a) the way it is written, the script assumes the working directory is the root directory for the data set "UCI HAR Dataset"
    b) the script uses the "dplyr" library - so please make sure you have the package installed before running
    
    Good luck!
